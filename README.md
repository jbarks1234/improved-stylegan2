Machine Learning Final Project

Our improved __StyleGAN2__ gives it 3D functionality as well as improved performance.

To run original model on new data: change directory in train_from_folder method
to run our 3D model on new data: change self.dataset in set_data_src method and change filter number parameters to desired number of data channels

Jacob - Worked on the code and suggested the 3-D change. Collaborated on Abstract, Final Project Update, Presentation, Report, etc.
